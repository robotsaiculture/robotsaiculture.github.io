**Fiona Andreallo** is an early career researcher and EC fellow at RMIT University, Melbourne with a research focus on technological-human relationships. She has published in interdisciplinary and digital cultures journals on the topic of social robots, dementia care as well as gender representation and gender performance. Fiona's current work extends from her book that identifies Technological cultural Touch as multiply significant and meaningful.  Focusing on algorithms as neither intelligent nor artificial but designed by humans and representative of cultural ideologies, Fiona has begun to consider the ways technology can be understood as practices of cultural Touch. Touch is an important but often overlooked element of health, well-being and communication. The focus of cultural Touch aims toward caring futures as well as providing a novel way to examine the ways technology both enables and constrains. [Download the open access book here](https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/G7MTCZY146sBxzgRUzu0HM?domain=link.springer.com "https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/5msuCQnMBZf6ORGEYSxUOWl?domain=link.springer.com")

**Shanti Sumartojo** is associate professor of Design Research in the Department of Design and a member of the Emerging Technologies Research Lab at Monash University. Grounded in human geography, and with a strong commitment to interdisciplinary and collaborative scholarship, her research includes theoretically-informed inquiry into the entanglements of the spatial, digital, sensory and affective in people's experiential worlds. Across a range of different empirical settings, she investigates how people engage with and understand design and technology in their surroundings, particularly in shared, public spaces and events. A recent focus has been on robots in public space, how they are productive of urban spatiality, and how people experience these technologies. To support this, she develops digital, visual, sensory and design ethnographic techniques, approaches that she also teaches and publishes on. [https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/shanti-sumartojo](https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/OgmwCgZ05JfQN8yWSx1doB?domain=research.monash.edu "https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/shanti-sumartojo")
